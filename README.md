# Sudoku solver 

This project prints the solution of a Sudoku in the console, in a user friendly manner. The sudoku is solved using the backtracking algorithm. 

The purpose of this project is build a simple script which solves sudokus. The rules of the sudoku game are: 
1. Each nonet, row and column must contain each number exactly once.
3. The sum of all the numbers in each nonet, row and column must be the number set by the user (Usually 45). 

The script itself contains one sudoku board which is solved, but it can be easily modified to solve another boards or received a board as an input.
